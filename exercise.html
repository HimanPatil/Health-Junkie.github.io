                            it. Place it on your lower traps, squeeze your shoulder blades together, push your elbows
                            up and nudge the bar out of the rack. Take a step or two back and stand with your feet at
                            shoulder width and your toes turned slightly out. Take a deep breath and bend your hips
                            back, then bend your knees to lower your body as far as you can without losing the arch in
                            your lower back. Push your knees out as you descend. Drive vertically with your hips to
                            come back up, continuing to push your knees out.

                            Sit down on a leg press machine and place your legs on the platform in front of you. Your
                            feet should be positioned approximately a foot to one and half feet apart. Lower the
                            safety bars holding the platform in place. Press the platform all the way up until your
                            legs are fully extended, without locking your knees. This is the starting position. As you
                            inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.
                            Push with the heels of your feet and use your quadriceps to go back to the starting
                            position. Exhale as you do so. Repeat for the number of reps in your set. Make sure that
                            the safety pins are locked properly once you have finished.

                        Pranamasana:
                        Also known as prayer pose, Pranamasana is the start of your Surya Namaskar. Stand upright on
                        your mat with your both feet closely aligned. Inhale deeply, expanding your chest and relaxing
                        your shoulders.

                        While you inhale, raise your arms from the sides. And as you exhale, join your palms together as
                        if praying in front of deity. This is the Pratham Namaskar or first salutation towards the sun.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hastauttanasana:
                        Keeping the palms joined in the previous prayer position, breathe in and lift your arms up and
                        bend backwards slightly. Your biceps should lie close to your ears. This posture is to loosen up
                        your body by stretching the entire body backwards, standing at your tip toes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hasta Padasana:
                        Now breathe out, and bend forward from the waist. Go down and touch you’re the ground but
                        keeping
                        your spine erect. Do this as your exhale slowly and completely.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ashwa Sanchalanasana:
                        Now breathe in, and stretch your body parallely to the ground. Keep your hands to the side, and
                        bring your right knee towards the right part of the chest and let your left leg stretch behind.
                        Look up.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Dandasana:
                        Now as your inhale, fling your right leg also backwards aligning your entire body parallely to
                        the
                        ground.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ashtanga Namaskara:
                        This is also known as giving salutations using eight parts or points. After staying in
                        Dandasana,
                        gently bring down your knees towards the floor and exhale. Now bring your chin to rest on the
                        floor, keep your hops elevated in the air. Hence, your eight parts which are two hands, two
                        knees,
                        chin and chest will rest on the floor while your hip stays elevated in the air.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        Bhujangasana:
                        This is also known as Cobra pose. This is simply aligning your chest and torso 90 degrees to the
                        ground, keeping your legs and mid-section flat on the ground. Make sure you use your hands to
                        support your body and are not tempted to transfer your entire weight onto them.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Parvatasana:
                        Again, return to the parvatasana from bhujangasana. Keep your palm and feet where they are, and
                        slowly raise your mid-section. Breathe out as you enter parvatasana.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Ashwa Sanchalanasana:
                        Now from Parvatasana, return to the ashwa sanchalanasana. But this time, we do the opposite of
                        what we did in the 4th step. Procedure- Bring your right foot forward, while resting the left
                        foot
                        behind, at its original position.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hasta Padasana:
                        Now slowly bring your left foot forward, next to the right foot as you exhale. Keeping the
                        position of your hands intact, lift yourself up to slowly enter Hasta Padasana.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hastauttanasana:
                        Now inhale, raise your hands upward, and bend backward to enter Ardha Chakra Asana.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Pranama asana:
                        Finally, exhale and stand in a relaxed manner in the namaskara mudra. Feel the positive
                        vibrations
                        in your body. This is how you complete one repetition of Surya Namaskar. Twelve repetitions of
                        this holistic exercise are said to yield maximum benefit.

                      Grab a handle in each hand and start with the rope behind you, so it's right at your heels and
                      jump over it. As the
                      rope swings up overhead, bend your knees slightly. Once you're at a comfortable speed, your wrists
                      can do all the work. As you hop, be sure to stay on the balls of your feet.

                      your sides with your palms facing down. Pushing through your heels, raise your hips off the ground
                      by squeezing your core, glutes, and hamstrings. Your upper back and shoulders should still be in
                      contact with the ground, and your core down to your knees should form a straight line. Pause 1–2
                      seconds at the top and return to the starting position.
